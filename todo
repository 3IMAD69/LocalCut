+fix this glitch later 
select output (video format) + select crop then select mp3 as output the crop box ui will still be in the player
+ make space play/pause the video 
+ add preview for rotate take a frame from the video and show it in the rotate ui



- for now crop is disabled when rotate is enable need to find a way to rotate the preview to make this work
